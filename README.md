# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
    We built an app that creates random combinations of book covers, titles and taglines for romantic novels. The user can create their own book covers, save book covers they like and view all of their saved covers. It generates potential romantic book covers from a database and allows the user to create their own. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
    Git clone git@github.com:wlavery22/romcom.git.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
    To understand how JS can be used to manipulate CSS & HTML in order to create, save and display images on a webpage and to use a random number generator to generate random covers, captions and images. We were able to store information by adding elements and objects into arrays to understand the relationship between the DOM and the data model. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
    Wins: We overcame iteration 3. We attempted iteration 4, and tried the splice and index of methods. We learned how to collaborate with our partners and other members of our cohort. We learned how to give and recieve help. We learned how to reach out to our rocks and mentors for assistance.
